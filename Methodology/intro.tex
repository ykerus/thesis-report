The following sections describe in detail how the data was obtained that was used, as this work makes use of simulated light curves. Subsequently, the network design and training procedure are described as well as the extensions that were explored, e.g. additional layers to predict within-gap flux values. Baselines and specific parameter choices which are dependent on the experiments, are described in the corresponding sections in Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}.
