Since this work makes use of simulated light curves, the following sections describe in detail how the data was obtained that was used. Subsequently, the network design and training procedure are described as well as the extensions that were explored. Baselines and specific parameter choices which are dependent on the experiments, are described in the corresponding sections in Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}.
