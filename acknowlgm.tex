\begin{abstract}
This work would not have been possible without the help of my supervisors. I would like to thank David Ruhe for his helpful insights and feedback throughout this project and for always being open to meet up if I felt like I was struggling with something. I would like to thank Bernard Foing, without whom I would not even have done this project, for always motivating and inspiring me to see the bigger picture. I would like to thank Ana M. Heras for her scientific view and for sharing it with me every Friday morning.

My fellow colleagues kept reminding me that I was not alone in this, which truly helped me maintain a healthy level of stress. I thank Chris for both the formal meetings over Zoom and informal meetings over a drink. I thank Victoria and Alex for helping me getting started, and for sharing their experiences from their master's theses.

Lastly, I would like to thank all my friends and family. Thanks to my flatmates for cooking dinner for me in times where I was clamped to my computer. Special thanks to my big sister Diede, who introduced me to the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.
