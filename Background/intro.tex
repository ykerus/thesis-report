The following sections provide necessary information to understand the research and the context in which this research was conducted. The transit method is further described in Section \ref{sec:transit} and the missions which are responsible for the available data in the field in Section \ref{sec:missions}. Challenges and their origins are described in Section \ref{sec:challenges}, after which we further discuss existing methods for transit detection in Section \ref{sec:detection_lit}. The theory and applications of RNNs are described in Section \ref{sec:rnn}, the last section of this chapter.
