The following sections provide necessary information to understand the research and the context in which this research was conducted. The transit method is further described, as well as the missions which are responsible for the available data in the field. Challenges and their origins are described in Section \ref{sec:challenges}, after which we further discuss existing methods for transit detection in Section \ref{sec:detection_lit}. The theory and applications of RNNs are described in the last section of this chapter.
