In a series of experiments using simulated data, we evaluated how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could be applied for the task of transit detection in light curves, and how they compare to existing approaches. 

To answer the question of how RNNs could be applied, we evaluated different data preprocessing steps, network architectures and training schemes. Our results suggested that simple gap-filling approaches such as linear interpolation or zero-filling can effectively and efficiently be used to deal with missing data. However, more research is needed in order to establish what method to deal with missing data works best in this task. Detrending or scaling light curves, apart from median scaling, was shown not to be necessary when the RNN is used for transit detection. However, detrending did lead to slightly better results, especially if short-scale patterns were kept intact. A slight increase of average precision (AP) of $\sim$0.015 of classifying data points as signal or non-signal was observed with this sort of low-risk detrending. Including centroid data as additional inputs to the network, also resulted in a positive, but smaller effect. Whether centroid data truly helps in the detection of transit signals should be confirmed in future work. Throughout this research, we found the most stable and best performing network to be a bidirectional GRU RNN with a single recurrent layer followed by two fully connected layers.  During training, we found that a small positive weight ($>1$) applied to all data points belonging to transit signals led to an increase of AP of up to 0.03 and allowed for setting more intuitive classification thresholds. Lastly, it was shown that a transit-specific weight can be adopted to balance the focus of the network during training, which also led to a slight increase in AP in some cases.

Two RNN-based algorithms were compared to box-fitting algorithms in the task of detecting transit signals in full-length light curves. These algorithms were referred to as PTS-Fold and PTS-Peak. Although PTS-Peak was at least an order of magnitude more efficient than PTS-Fold, PTS-Fold consistently detected more planets than PTS-Peak. However, the BLS algorithm from \cite{kovacs2002box} still outperformed both algorithms in terms of AP. The best RNN-based detection algorithm achieved an AP of 0.59 and BLS and AP of 0.66 in the task of retrieving 2500 planets from a set of 5000 light curves.  In the case of monotransits, i.e. transit signals which only occur once in a light curve, we found the RNN to outperform the box-fitting algorithm from \cite{foreman2016population} with an AP of 0.43, compared to an AP of 0.35 from the baseline. In the search for monotransits, the RNN outputs can directly be used for detection, and light curves can be processed very efficiently ($>$50 light curves with $\sim$ 20000 data points per second). Overall, we found that the fewer the transits, the more potential the RNN has of improving over box-fitting algorithms both in terms of efficiency and detection performance.

However, the main result of our research is not that there was a slight winner in each of the experiments. In fact, we found both the box-fitting algorithms and the RNN-based algorithms to detect exoplanets that the other methods were not able to detect. From the 2500 monotransits, the RNN detected 298 planets which the box-fitting algorithm was not able to detect at 0.5 precision, which in turn detected 74 planets which the RNN was not able to detect. In the task of retrieving repeating transit signals from 2500 planets, the RNN-based algorithm detected 49 planets which BLS was not able to detect, which in turn detected 224 planets which the RNN-based algorithm was not able to detect. In other words, the methods performed complementary. For exoplanet science, this is an important result, as the RNN might open the door to detecting exoplanets in real-world data previously missed by commonly used detection methods. Future will tell, as this method has yet to be applied to real-world light curves. Even though these may only include a handful of undiscovered exoplanets, with every new detection our view of the universe, and our place therein, becomes more complete.
