The main questions in thesis were whether and how RNNs could be used for the detection of transit signals, and whether they provide a competitive and efficient alternative to existing approaches. In addition, we attempted to investigate how the outputs of the RNN could be made more interpretable for this task, such that it would benefit the transit detection algorithm. In the following, we discuss these questions with regard to the results presented in Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}. The subsequent sections describe the limitations of this work and directions for future work.
