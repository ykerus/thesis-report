\section{Implications of results}

In the end, the most important result of the experiments is not whether there was a winner with slightly more correct detections than the other methods. The fact is that in each case, our RNN-based detection algorithm was able to find planets that BLS could not find, given our implementation of this algorithm.

\todo{explain and emphasize that complementary algorithms are of great importance in the search for new exoplanets}


\todo{furthermore, RNN did show a larger potential in the task of monotransit detections, which is considered harder than multi transit detection. RNN does not rely on periodiciies and detrending, and thus is ideal for monotransit detection. Suggestion: future research focus on monotransit detection}
