\red{[TODO]}
\bullets{• though we have only experimented with plain transit signals, one could simulate only, e.g. disintegrating rocky exoplanet transit signal to conduct a more focused search\\
• predict and utlize parameters such as duration, depth, etc to be used for computing SNR (= depth/noise * sqrt(duration)) to subsequently sett a threshold for detected candidates\\
• then an extension could be to provide uncertainties over these parameters, though tricky\\
• furthermore, aim to include periodicity into output of the model (struggled with during thesis)\\
• develop a benchmark dataset + clearly defined task (e.g. requiring determination of P and t0), so AI practitioners from outside this field could contribute further}
