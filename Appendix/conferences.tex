\section{Conference and workshop contributions}


This work has been communicated to the scientific community through presentations and abstracts at several international conferences and workshops. Early on in the project, the abstract titled ``Towards Deep Learning for Transiting Exoplanet Search Using Simulated TESS Data''\footnote{\url{https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/2080.pdf}} \citep{rusticus2021towards} was submitted to and accepted by the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC). At this conference, both a 3-minute live lightning talk and pre-recorded presentation of 15 minutes were given. At the annual meeting of 2021 of the European Astronomical Society (EAS), the abstract titled ``A Transit Detection Algorithm Based on Recurrent Neural Networks''\footnote{\url{https://eas.kuoni-congress.info/2021/programme/abstract/1918}} was accepted. This resulted in a live 15-minute presentation in the session for ``machine learning and visualisation in data intensive era''. Lastly, at several EuroMoonMars (EMM) workshops, presentations of 5-10 minutes were given for ESA scientists, students and collaborators.
