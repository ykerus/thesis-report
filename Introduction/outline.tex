\label{sec:outline}

This thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter \ref{chap:background}, the necessary background is given, such as the transit method and existing approaches to detect transit signals in light curves. The details of our proposed methods are described in Chapter \ref{chap:methodology}. In Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}, we present the experiments and results, which are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:discussion}. Finally, the work is summarized and concluded in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}. Appendix \ref{appendix} can be referred to for additional information, for example on conference contributions that were based on this work.
