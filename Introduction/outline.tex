\section{Outline}

Since the problems and challenges in exoplanet science differ substantially from more ``typical'' AI-problems encountered on Earth, a large portion of Chapter \ref{chap:background} is devoted to create a common ground. Exoplanets are described in further detail, as well as noteworthy discoveries, discovery methods and facilities. A detailed description of the challenges of detecting transit signals is given, and we discuss previously proposed approaches to the problem. Furthermore, we discuss work on AI applied to different problems in exoplanet science, and other related work. Chapter \ref{chap:methodology} describes our proposed method, as well the simulated data that was used in the experiments. In Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}, the RNN-based detection algorithm is evaluated and compared to other methods, such as the Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm \cite{kovacs2002box}. The results are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:discussion} and in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions} the main conclusions are given and the work is summarized.
