\label{sec:aims}

The field of exoplanet science has seen a rapid increase in the amount of data over the last decades. For this reason, artificial intelligence (AI) has come to play a more important role in the discovery of exoplanets. Most applications of AI, however, focus on the identification step, e.g. \textit{Autovetter} \citep{catanzarite2015autovetter}, \textit{Robovetter} \citep{coughlin2017planet} and \textit{AstroNet} \citep{shallue2018identifying}. Few works exist on the application of AI for the detection of transit signals, an example of which is the work of \cite{pearson2018searching}. Following their line of research, we aim at contributing to the development of AI-based algorithms for transit signal detection, with the goal to overcome limitations encountered in previous approaches.
