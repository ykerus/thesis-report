The discovery of exoplanets is the first step in answering a broad range of fundamental questions. Is our solar system one of a kind? Is there life elsewhere in the universe? Exoplanets, short for extrasolar planets, are planets orbiting stars other than our Sun. It was only after the 90's that scientists became certain of their existence and nowadays more than 4000 examples are known\footnote{\url{https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html}}. Several approaches to exoplanet discovery exist, the most successful of which is the transit method. This method relies on the rare event that a planet moves in front of its host star with respect to our line of sight, an event that occasionally occurs for Mercury and Venus. Transits express themselves in the form of periodic dips in the observed brightness of a star over time.  The detection of these dips in stellar data is therefore essential to the discovery of new exoplanets. 

In the following sections, the problem of detecting transit signals is described in further detail, as well as the motivation to approach this problem from different perspectives. Common approaches and limitations are given, to shape our understanding of how the solution to this problem could benefit from artificial intelligence (AI). The contributions and outline of this work are given in the last sections of this chapter.
