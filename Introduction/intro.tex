The discovery of exoplanets is the first step in answering a broad range of fundamental questions in astronomy. Is our solar system one of a kind? Is there life elsewhere in the universe? Exoplanets, short for extrasolar planets, are planets orbiting stars other than our Sun.
The problem of detecting exoplanets is an active region of science and is described in more detail in the first section of this chapter, i.e. Section \ref{sec:problem}. In Section \ref{sec:aims}, we state our general research aims. Commonly used approaches and their limitations are briefly discussed in Section \ref{sec:approaches}, after which we outline our proposed method to address these limitations in Section \ref{sec:proposed}. The structure of this thesis as a whole is described in Section \ref{sec:outline}.
